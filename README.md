# Vagrant kubeadm k8s cluster

Forked from: https://github.com/techiescamp/vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes  

Changes:

- updated to k8s 1.28.4, standard Ubuntu Jammy
- removed Calico and dashboard functionality, choose your own CNI
- changed default nodes CIDR to 10.8.0.10 to avoid issues with other defaults (e.g., cilium)

## Prerequisites

1. Working Vagrant setup
2. 12+ RAM workstation as the vms use 2+1+1+1 vCPUS and 10+ GB RAM

## For MAC/Linux Users

The latest version of Virtualbox for Mac/Linux can cause issues.

Create/edit the /etc/vbox/networks.conf file and add the following to avoid any network-related issues.
<pre>* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0</pre>

or run below commands

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/vbox/
echo "* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0" | sudo tee -a /etc/vbox/networks.conf
```

So that the host only networks can be in any range, not just 192.168.56.0/21 as described here:
